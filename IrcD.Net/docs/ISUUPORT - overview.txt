This document is an overview of all the parameters used in the 005 numeric (RPL_ISUPPORT) of the IRC protocol, with a short description of what all the parameters mean.

For a more formal defenition of the ISUPPORT numeric see Edward Brocklesby's ISUPPORT draft.

This page now just lists some examples of what is being used, which include things not in the draft. The reason they're not in draft is because they are either experimental or considered to be of no real use.

A simple example output:

:irc.example.org 005 nick PREFIX=(ov)@+ CHANTYPES=#& :are supported by this server

Here is the list with all parameters with a short description:

Parameter 	Value 	Servers 	Explanation 	Example
PREFIX 	(modes)prefixes 	all 	A list of channel modes a person can get and the respective prefix a channel or nickname will get in case the person has it. The order of the modes goes from most powerful to least powerful. Those prefixes are shown in the output of the WHOIS, WHO and NAMES command.

Note: Some servers only show the most powerful, others may show all of them.
	PREFIX=(ov)@+ (IRCNet, Bahamut, ircu)
PREFIX=(ohv)@%+ (Hybrid)
CHANTYPES 	chars 	all 	The supported channel prefixes. 	CHANTYPES=#& (ircu)
CHANTYPES=#&!+ (IRCNet)
CHANTYPES=# (Bahamut)
CHANTYPES=#& (Hybrid)
CHANMODES 	A,B,C,D 	all 	This is a list of channel modes according to 4 types.
A = Mode that adds or removes a nick or address to a list. Always has a parameter.
B = Mode that changes a setting and always has a parameter.
C = Mode that changes a setting and only has a parameter when set.
D = Mode that changes a setting and never has a parameter.

Note: Modes of type A return the list when there is no parameter present.

Note: Some clients assumes that any mode not listed is of type D.

Note: Modes in PREFIX are not listed but could be considered type B.
	CHANMODES=b,k,l,imnpstr (ircu)
CHANMODES=b,k,l,ciLmMnOprRst (Bahamut)
CHANMODES=beI,k,l,imnpstaqr (IRCNet)

Note: This has been replaced by MAXLIST.
	MAXBANS=30 (IRCNet)
MAXBANS=25 (Hybrid)

MAXBANS=100 (Bahamut)
MAXLIST 	mode:num[,mode:num,...] 	all 	Maximum number entries in the list per mode. 	MAXLIST=beI:30 (IRCNet)
NETWORK 	name 	all 	The IRC network name. 	NETWORK=EFnet (Hybrid)

WALLCHOPS 	  	Hybrid, ircu 	The server supports messaging channel operators (NOTICE @#channel)

Note: This has been replaced by STATUSMSG.

ircu also supports a WALLCHOPS command?

Note: ircu didn't support voiced persons because it conflicted with +channels. They removed the +channels.

Note: Hybrid supports everything in PREFIX

Note: Hybrid 6 and ircu don't support it with PRIVMSG, Hybrid 7 does.
	WALLCHOPS
WALLVOICES 	  	ircu 	Notice to +#channel goes to all voiced persons. 	WALLVOICES
STATUSMSG 	string 	ratbox 	The server supports messaging channel member who have a certain status or higher. The status is one of the letters from PREFIX. 	STATUSMSG=+@
CASEMAPPING 	string 	all 	Case mapping used for nick- and channel name comparing. Current possible values:

ascii: The chars [a-z] are lowercase of [A-Z].

rfc1459: ascii with additional {}|~ the lowercase of []\^.

strict-rfc1459: ascii with additional {}| the lowercase of []\.

Note: RFC1459 forgot to mention the ~ and ^ although in all known implementations those are considered equivalent too.
	CASEMAPPING=rfc1459 (ircu, Hybrid, IRCNet)
CASEMAPPING=ascii (Bahamut)
ELIST 	tokens 	  		The server supports extentions for the LIST command. The tokens specify which extention are supported.

FNC 	  	IRCNet 	Forced nick changes: The server may change the nickname without the client sending a NICK message. 	FNC
SAFELIST 	  	Bahamut 	The LIST is sent in multiple iterations so send queue won't fill and kill the client connection. 	SAFELIST
AWAYLEN 	number 	ircu 	The max length of an away message 	AWAYLEN=160 (ircu)
NOQUIT 	  	Bahamut 	Isn't this server to server feature, nothing to do with clients? 	NOQUIT

LANGUAGE 	number,string,string,... 	KineIRCd 	[Experimental] The server supports the LANGUAGE command. See the language document for more information. 	LANGUAGE=2,en,i-klingon

Some of those parameters define a length. This is a length in octets and not in (multi-byte) characters.

I would like to be able to place some links to commands like SILENCE, USERIP, CPRIVMSG, CNOTICE, KNOCK, and others. Whatever may be useful to client authors. They don't seem to put any documentation online.

Some older version of this document said CHARMAPPING instead of CASEMAPPING. This was an error and has been corrected.

CHARSET has been removed. See the draft for explanation.
